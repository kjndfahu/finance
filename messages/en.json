This plan involves purchasing an index rather than buying shares directly. Our experts create an index to maximise returns by referencing news, patterns, using historical data as well as bespoke algorithms created for our company. Buying an index allows you to invest in a wide range of companies, in the case of a fall in the value of one of the stocks, the growth of another will cover this fall. In this regard, the investor always receives a guaranteed profit. Investing by buying an index is an effective tool for achieving your financial goals. This strategy provides diversification, stable capital growth and ease of investment."

This investment plan provides for the buyout and sale of stakes in promising start-ups at various stages of their development. We actively participate in the equity of start-up companies, providing them with funding in exchange for a stake in the business. What is venture capital investment? Venture capital investment is the process of financing young and promising companies (start-ups) that have high growth potential. Such investments are usually made in exchange for an equity stake in the company. Our company plays an active role in the development of start-ups, providing not only financial resources, but also expert support, strategic guidance and a network of contacts. High return potential: Successful start-ups provide multiple returns on the money invested. Our investments generate significant returns, exceeding the initial investment by tens or even hundreds of times. Venture investing allows us to diversify our investment portfolio by allocating capital across different sectors and companies. This helps us to significantly increase our returns."

    "text1": "The main way to generate income from venture capital investments is to successfully exit the investment (exit). This can be the sale of our stake to other investors, strategic partners, or a company going public. In such cases, the value of our stakes increases significantly When a startup in which we hold a significant stake goes public, we sell part or all of our stake on the public market. The share price at the IPO stage is usually significantly higher than the initial value of our investment, allowing us to realise a significant profit. We carefully assess potential and market conditions to choose the optimal time to sell our stakes, thereby maximising the return on our investment. We are actively involved in buying shares in companies at their IPO stage. Investing in shares at the stage of their initial public offering is often accompanied by a significant increase in their value in the short term, which allows us to receive high returns. By participating in IROs of various companies from different industries, we ensure diversification of our portfolio, which helps us to earn money at all times. We thoroughly analyse companies before their IPOs, assessing their business models, financial performance and growth prospects in order to make an informed choice."
